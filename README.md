# DS4002-CS3
This repository contains the full set of materials for a case study exploring whether average daily temperature is correlated with reported crime in Charlottesville, Virginia. Students completing this case study will work through real datasets, perform statistical analysis, and interpret their findings using guided prompts.

# Important Information 
The Hook Document introduces the scenario and motivates the analysis. The Rubric outlines all expectations, deliverables, formatting requirements, and how the case study will be evaluated. Your analysis will take place in the notebook `correlation.ipynb` inside the `SCRIPTS` folder. All required tasks are marked with **TODO** comments for clarity. Once you complete the analysis, you will record your interpretations in `results.md`, also locagted in the `SCRIPTS` folder

## Data 
This case study uses real crime data from the UVA Open Data Portal, provided here as:
- `Crime_Data.csv` (located in the `DATA` folder)
- Weather data is retrieved programmatically using the **Meteostat** Python library. To run the notebook successfully, you should have the following packages installed:
    - datetime
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - pathlib
    - scipy
    - seaborn
